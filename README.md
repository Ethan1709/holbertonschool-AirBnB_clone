# AirBnB clone - The console

A group project at Holberton-School Paris

## What is this ?

It is the first step towards building a full web application. This project is entierly in Python. Here are the main implementations in this project:

- Creation of the parent class called BaseModel that creates the flow between serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- Creation of child classes that inherits from the main class BaseModel: such as User, State, City, Place, review, state, amenity...
- Creation of the class FileStorage which is a storage engine
- Creation of the console
- And making test files to handle errors we may encounter
